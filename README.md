## Development of a web-based resource for breast cancer genomic data exploration

### Abstract 
The constant increase of genomic data generated from rapid and cost-effective high-throughput sequencing technologies represent a fundamental resource to get detailed insights of tumor samples composition by a comprehensive view of the mutational landscape from single base mutations to chromosomal or whole genome-scale events. Consequently, the need for computational suites for analyzing, summarizing, and extract meaningful information are in high demand.
Breast cancer (BRCA) has emerged as the second major cancer type comprising almost 25% of all cancers among women. In the last decades, scientific research focused on the characterization of its molecular subtypes to identify driver somatic events and consequently improve the efficacy of current clinical treatments. 
In this work, I present BroadBand, a web-based resource developed with the Shiny R package, designed for the exploration of genomic data selected among a comprehensive selection of breast cancer (BRCA) studies with available information on somatic single nucleotide variants (SNVs), somatic copy number alterations (SCNAs), and stratified by BRCA molecular subtypes.
BroadBand allows an intuitive and custom exploration of SNVs and SCNAs data which can be filtered and summarized with a resolution level from gene to chromosome level and stratified across BRCA molecular subtypes and tumor classifications. 
All retrieved information is reported and summarized as figures and tables, resulting in a valuable resource for additional downstream analysis or novel experimental designs.
